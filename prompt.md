# The Prompt

A reference for everything the KronuZSH prompt shows and every knob that changes
it. It's a single self-contained theme in [`lib/prompt.zsh`](lib/prompt.zsh), no framework.
For the internals (how the deferred strings render, how to add a segment), see the
"prompt" section of [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); this file is the user-facing manual.

Every option is an environment variable you set in `~/.zshrc.local` (in your home
dir, never committed). All
of them are optional: out of the box the prompt auto-detects your terminal, font,
OS, and session and does the right thing.

## What you see

A typical prompt, after a command that failed and took a while (shown with the
plain-Unicode glyphs so it renders anywhere; with a Nerd Font the `⎇`, `venv`, and
time marks become polished icons). The exit code and duration sit on their own line
on top, then the info line, then the line you type on:

```
⏎ 1  3.2s
● gmendezb at host.example.com (10.0.0.5)  ⎇ main ⇡1 ✛2 ✴3  venv myproj
[16:26:02] ~/Development/KronuZSH ❯❯❯
```

Read top to bottom:

```
⏎ 1          exit code    the nonzero exit status (only when the last command failed)
3.2s         duration     how long it ran (only past a threshold); shares the top line
●            status dot   green if the last command succeeded, red if it failed
gmendezb     user         %n
at host…     host         OS logo (Nerd Font) + hostname + cached LAN IP
⎇ main …     git          branch/tag/commit, ahead/behind, staged/modified/…
venv myproj  venv         the active Python virtualenv ($VIRTUAL_ENV)
```

The **top line is conditional**: it shows only when the last command failed or was
slow, and is absent entirely on a quick, clean command (so a normal prompt is just
the info line and the input line). Bottom line: `[time]`, the working directory, and
the caret (`❯❯❯`) you type at. On the **right** (RPROMPT): the vi/emacs keymap
indicator and an overwrite-mode mark. Segments that have nothing to show (no git
repo, no venv) simply don't render, so the prompt stays as short as the moment allows.

Other segments that appear when relevant: a background-jobs count, an SSH or
container badge, and an `etctl:<name>` tag inside an Eternal Terminal session.


## Quick start

The tweaks people reach for first, all in `~/.zshrc.local`:

```zsh
# No Nerd Font installed? Flip the whole prompt to plain-Unicode glyphs:
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_NERD_FONT=0

# Show a command's duration sooner (default: only when it ran 3s+):
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_CMD_DURATION_MIN=1

# Past commands collapse to a faded caret. Make the faded command grey instead
# of dimmed, or turn the whole transient behavior off:
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_STYLE=mute
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT=''

# Recolor a segment (any name from the color table below):
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_HOST='$col[chartreuse]'

# Swap or hide a single glyph:
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_GLYPH_MODIFIED='*'
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_GLYPH_OS=''
```

## Glyphs

The prompt ships two full glyph sets and picks one automatically:

- **Nerd Font** (default): the polished icon set. Needs a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
  installed and selected in your terminal (see [README](README.md#fonts-nerd-font)
  and [nerd_fonts.md](nerd_fonts.md)).
- **Plain Unicode**: BMP symbols that render in any normal font. Switch to it with
  `PROMPT_KRONUZ_NERD_FONT=0` (also accepts `no`, `off`, `false`). It's also forced
  automatically on a `dumb`/unknown terminal, where Nerd Font glyphs would be tofu.

Override any single glyph in either set with `PROMPT_KRONUZ_GLYPH_<NAME>`: set it to
a character of your choice, or to `''` to hide it. The name is the uppercased key
from this table. The **Plain** column shows the literal fallback glyph; the **Nerd
Font** column gives the icon's Nerd Font name and codepoint (it renders as an icon
only in a Nerd Font, so it's named here rather than shown):

| Name         | Plain | Nerd Font                       | Meaning                          |

| `caret_alt`  |  ❮    | ❮ U+276E (same)                 | prompt caret (vicmd keymap)      |

Rows marked "(same)" use the same BMP mark in both sets (they render in any font);
the rest are true Nerd Font icons in the default set and the Plain glyph otherwise.

### A note on glyph spacing

Some Nerd Font icons (the ones in the Private Use Area) render slightly wider than
one cell and can collide with the text right after them. The prompt detects those
per-glyph and inserts a single trailing space automatically; single-width symbols
and text labels get none. So a count next to a wide icon (` 12`) is spaced, but a
plain mark (`✴3`) isn't. You don't configure this; it just keeps columns honest.

## Colors

Color is fully automatic. There are two layers:

1. A **base palette** of named colors (`red`, `chartreuse`, `darkorange`, ...),
   each an `%F{...}` escape. ANSI 0..15 stay as `%F{0..15}` so they follow your
   terminal theme; 16..255 are exact hex (truecolor), downsampled by `zsh/nearcolor`
   on terminals that can't do truecolor.
2. A **semantic layer** that maps each part of the prompt to a base color.

Override any semantic color with `PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_<NAME>`. The value is
evaluated, so you can reference a base-palette name or write a raw escape:

```zsh
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_HOST='$col[chartreuse]'   # by palette name
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_TIME='%F{45}'             # by raw zsh color
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_BRANCH='%B$col[white]'    # %B = bold
```

You can also override a **base** ANSI color with `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_<NAME>` (a
`#RRGGBB` or a 0-255 index) — `RED`, `BLUE`, `LIGHTGREEN`, and the rest of the 16. This
pins that color across the whole prompt (everything built on it) and tells `dim` its
real RGB, which is the clean way to match a terminal whose palette can't be queried (see
[Transient prompt](#transient-prompt)):

```zsh
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_RED='#ff5c57'   # fixed red, instead of the theme's %F{1}
```

The semantic names and their defaults:

| Name(s)                                   | Default            | Used for                          |

| `ip`                                      | dark grey          | LAN IP next to the host           |
| `user`                                    | bold white         | username                          |

| `info`, `sep`                             | dark grey          | the "at" / separators             |

| `vim` / `emacs`                           | bold green         | editor keymap indicators          |
| `overwrite`                               | red                | overwrite-mode mark               |
| `insert` / `completing`                   | dark grey / black  | caret keymap states               |
| `transient`                               | dark grey          | the collapsed transient caret     |
| `primary1/2/3`                            | red/yellow/green   | the three carets of `❯❯❯`         |

(`primary1/2/3` are also swapped to all-red when running as root, via a `%(!..)`
test, as are `pwd` and `user`.)

### No-color mode

A `dumb`/unknown terminal (Emacs `M-x shell`, some CI) or `NO_COLOR=1`
([no-color.org](https://no-color.org)) blanks every semantic color, so the full
layout still renders with zero escapes. It's re-evaluated every prompt, so
`export NO_COLOR=1` (and `unset`) take effect on the very next prompt.

## Behavior

### The status line (exit code + duration)

When the last command **failed or was slow**, the prompt shows a line on top, above
the info row, with its exit code (`⏎<code>`) and/or duration. On a quick, clean
command that line is absent entirely. When you submit the next command, that line
stays behind in scrollback (dimmed, per your transient style), so your history reads
as a quiet log of what failed or dragged. See [Transient prompt](#transient-prompt).

### Command duration

After a command runs longer than `PROMPT_KRONUZ_CMD_DURATION_MIN` seconds
(default `3`), the status line above shows how long it took, formatted compactly:
`3.2s`, `1m05s`, `1h02m03s`. Set the threshold to `0` to always show it.

### Background jobs

When you have stopped or backgrounded jobs, the prompt shows the job glyph and the
count (`%j`). Nothing renders when there are none.

### Session context

Two badges are detected once at shell startup and stay for its life:

- **SSH**: shown when any of `$SSH_CONNECTION` / `$SSH_TTY` / `$SSH_CLIENT` is set.
- **Container**: shown when `/.dockerenv`, `/run/.containerenv`, or `$container`
  indicates you're inside one.

The Eternal Terminal session cue is the separate `etctl:<name>` tag (in magenta),
shown whenever `$ETCTL_SESSION` is set, so you can tell at a glance which managed
remote session a shell belongs to.

### Working directory

The path segment shows the full working directory with `$HOME` abbreviated to `~`
(`~/Development/KronuZSH/integrations/bat`). `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD_STYLE` shortens it:

| Value | Example | |
|-------|---------|--|
| `full` (default) | `~/Development/KronuZSH/integrations/bat` | the whole path, home as `~` |
| `short` | `~/D/k/i/bat` | fish-style: each parent shrunk to its first character (a leading dot is kept, so `.config` → `.c`), the current directory in full |
| `base` | `bat` | just the current directory's name |
| `absolute` | `/Users/gmendezb/Development/KronuZSH/integrations/bat` | the whole path with `$HOME` expanded |

```zsh
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD_STYLE=short
```

For full control of the segment (a fixed prompt string, `%`-escapes), override
`PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD` instead — see [Replacing a whole segment](#replacing-a-whole-segment).

## Transient prompt

When you press Enter, the prompt for the command you just ran collapses to a compact
line: the **directory it ran in**, then a short caret. So your scrollback reads as a
column of `path ❯ command` instead of a wall of repeated full prompts, and you can see
where each command was run. The live prompt above the cursor is always the full one;
only the past ones shrink. A command that **failed or was slow** also leaves its outcome
line (the `⏎<code>` / duration) behind, dimmed, so scrollback stays a quiet log of what
happened.

The collapsed path reuses your `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD_STYLE` (so `short`/`base` shorten it
there too) and uses the live `pwd` colour (so it matches the prompt and honours
`PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_PWD`).

The collapsed line is built the same way as the live prompt, and is configured
symmetrically: `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT` is the whole string (like `PROMPT`) and
`PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_CARET` is just the caret piece (like `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PROMPT` is
the live caret), so you can swap the caret for an emoji without rebuilding the rest. Both
take deferred `${...}` segments and are re-evaluated on every Enter, and the whole
resolved line — pwd, caret, and your own `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT` if you set one — is
restyled together by `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_STYLE`.

```
~/project ❯ cd src
~/project/src ❯ make
⏎ 2          ← make failed; its outcome line stays, dimmed
~/project/src ❯ ./run --watch
3.4s         ← slow; the dimmed duration stays
● gmendezb at host (10.0.0.5)  ⎇ main ❯❯❯        ← the live prompt, full color
```

These variables control it (the palette knobs `dim` relies on are described under the
styles below, and listed in full in the option reference):

| Variable                       | Default            | Effect                                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT`      | `pwd ❯`            | The whole collapsed prompt string (by default the directory the command ran in, then a caret), built like `PROMPT` from deferred `${...}` segments. Set to `''` to disable transience entirely (past prompts stay full), or to any string for a custom collapsed prompt (which is itself restyled per `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_STYLE`). |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_CARET`| `❯`                | Just the caret piece of the default collapsed line — symmetric to `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PROMPT` for the live prompt. Set to an emoji or any string to change the caret without touching the rest. Ignored if you override the whole `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT`. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_STYLE`| `dim`              | How the collapsed line — the pwd, caret, and the just-run **command** (plus the kept outcome line) — is restyled: `dim`, `mute`, or `keep`. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_DIM`  | `0.7`              | For `dim`: darkness factor, `0` = black, `1` = unchanged. Lower is darker. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_HL`   | `fg=8`             | For `mute`: the `region_highlight` spec to paint the command with (default = grey). |

The three styles:

- **`dim`** keeps the command's own syntax colors but darkens them, so the line
  reads as faded history without losing its shape. The default factor (`0.7`) is a
  moderate fade; go lower (`0.4` to `0.5`) for darker, higher (`0.85`+) for subtler.
  To darken the right hue, the prompt needs your terminal's real 16 ANSI colors. It
  gets each from its `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_<NAME>` override if you set one, else from
  an on-disk cache, else a one-time **OSC 4** query of the terminal (cached afterward
  for `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_TTL`); if nothing answers it falls back to the xterm
  defaults. Over a remote shell (e.g. SSH or Eternal Terminal) the query round-trip is
  network-bound, so the cache and a generous `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_TIMEOUT` matter; if
  your terminal still can't be queried, just pin the 16 base colors in `~/.zshrc.local`
  (which also fixes the displayed colors, and skips the query entirely):

  ```zsh
  # iTerm "Snazzy" — your terminal's 16 ANSI colors as #RRGGBB.
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_BLACK='#000000'    PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_DARKGREY='#686868'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_RED='#ff5c57'      PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTRED='#ff5c57'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_GREEN='#5af78e'    PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTGREEN='#5af78e'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_YELLOW='#f3f99d'   PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTYELLOW='#f3f99d'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_BLUE='#57c7ff'     PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTBLUE='#57c7ff'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_MAGENTA='#ff6ac1'  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTMAGENTA='#ff6ac1'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_CYAN='#9aedfe'     PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTCYAN='#9aedfe'
  PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_GREY='#f1f1f0'     PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_LIGHTGREY='#eff0eb'
  ```
- **`mute`** repaints the whole command in one flat color (grey by default; change
  it with `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_HL`).
- **`keep`** leaves the syntax colors untouched.

### The exit code lives above the caret, not in it

A natural wish is to color the caret of a failed command red. The caret itself
can't be: it's drawn the moment you press Enter, before the command runs, so at
caret-draw time its own result doesn't exist yet. Instead the result shows on the
**line above** the caret. The live prompt puts the `⏎<code>` / duration on its own
line, and when you submit the next command that line stays behind (dimmed) in
scrollback, so past failures and slow commands are still visible at a glance. The
terminal also gets the machine-readable version via the OSC 133 `D;<exitcode>` mark
the prompt emits per command, which terminals like iTerm2 use to flag failed
commands in the gutter.

## Terminal integration

On a capable terminal (skipped on `dumb`/unknown), the prompt emits standard
shell-integration escape sequences so the terminal can do more for you:

- **OSC 7** (current directory): new tabs and splits open in the same `$PWD`.
- **OSC 133** (prompt/command marks `A`/`B`/`C`/`D;exit`): jump between prompts,
  show per-command success/failure, select command output. The `D;<exitcode>` mark
  carries the real `$?`, so the terminal knows which commands failed.
- **OSC 1337** (iTerm2 only): also reports host and directory to iTerm2's own
  integration, on top of the cross-terminal OSC 133 marks.

There's nothing to configure; it activates wherever the terminal understands it.

## Replacing a whole segment

Beyond colors and glyphs, you can override a segment's entire content with
`PROMPT_KRONUZ_<SEGMENT>`. The value is a prompt string (zsh `%`-escapes and
`$col[...]` / `$glyph[...]` references work). Available segments: `OS`, `ERR`,
`USER`, `IP`, `TIME`, `PWD`, `GIT`, `VENV`, `JOBS`, `CONTEXT`, `ETCTL`, `VIM`,
`EMACS`, `OVERWRITE`, `PROMPT`. (`HOST` is composed from `USER` + `IP` and isn't
overridable on its own — change those two, or the `host` color. The exit code and
duration aren't their own overridable segments either; they're built into the
status line on top, formatted by `_kronuz_status_segment`.)

```zsh
# A 24-hour clock with seconds instead of the default [%*]:
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_TIME='[%D{%H:%M:%S}]'

# Just the basename of the cwd (or simpler: PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD_STYLE=base; for the
# fish-style ~/D/k/i/bat, PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD_STYLE=short):
export PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD='%1~'
```

For deeper changes (adding a brand-new segment, reordering the line), edit
`lib/prompt.zsh` directly; the [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) "Add a segment" recipe walks
through it.

## Full option reference

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_NERD_FONT` | `1` | `0`/`no`/`off`/`false` switches to the plain-Unicode glyph set. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_GLYPH_<NAME>` | (per glyph) | Override one glyph; `''` hides it. Names in the glyph table. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_<NAME>` | (per color) | Override one semantic color. Names in the color table. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_<SEGMENT>` | (built-in) | Replace a segment's whole content. Names in "Replacing a whole segment". |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PWD_STYLE` | `full` | Working-directory shortening: `full`, `short` (`~/D/k/i/bat`), `base` (current dir name), or `absolute` (`$HOME` expanded). |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_CMD_DURATION_MIN` | `3` | Seconds a command must run before its duration is shown. `0` = always. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT` | `pwd ❯` | The whole collapsed past-prompt string (default: the run directory + caret), built like `PROMPT`; `''` disables transience. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_CARET` | `❯` | Just the caret piece of the default collapsed line (symmetric to `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PROMPT`); set to an emoji or any string. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_STYLE` | `dim` | Restyle of the collapsed line (pwd, caret, command): `dim`, `mute`, or `keep`. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_DIM` | `0.7` | `dim` darkness factor (`0` black .. `1` unchanged). |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_TRANSIENT_HL` | `fg=8` | `mute` color, as a `region_highlight` spec. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_<NAME>` | (per color) | Override one of the 16 ANSI base colors (`RED`, `LIGHTBLUE`, ...) to a `#RRGGBB` or 0-255 index; sets the displayed color and `dim`'s RGB. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_TTL` | `86400` | Seconds the queried palette is cached on disk (per terminal); `0` disables the cache. |
| `PROMPT_KRONUZ_PALETTE_TIMEOUT` | `0.6` | Seconds to wait for the OSC 4 palette answer; bump it for a slow/remote terminal. |
| `zstyle :kronuz:editor:keymap:primary` | `❯❯❯` | The live caret in the primary keymap (emacs / vi-insert), as a zstyle `format` string. |
| `zstyle :kronuz:editor:keymap:alternate` | `❮❮❮` | The live caret in the vi-command keymap. |
| `zstyle :kronuz:editor:keymap:overwrite` | (overwrite glyph) | The `RPROMPT` marker shown while overwrite mode is on. |
| `COLORTERM` | (terminal) | `24bit`/`truecolor` keeps the hex palette at 24-bit; otherwise colors degrade to 256/16 via `zsh/nearcolor`. |
| `TERM` | (terminal) | `dumb`/`unknown`/empty forces the plain-glyph set and no color (see no-color mode). |
| `NO_COLOR` | (unset) | Standard env var; when set, renders with no color escapes. |

Anything not set falls back to the built-in default, and every variable is read
live, so editing `~/.zshrc.local` and starting a new shell is all it takes.
