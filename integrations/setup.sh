# integrations/setup.sh — install-time setup for the external-tool integrations, one
# file per tool (integrations/<tool>/setup.sh). install.sh sources this; it's also
# safe to run on its own (`bash integrations/setup.sh`) to re-apply just the tool
# config without re-linking the runcoms. Each tool's step is guarded on its tool and
# idempotent.
#
# Written for bash (install.sh is bash and sources it), avoiding zsh-isms; each
# setup.sh self-locates its own dir to find bundled themes.
