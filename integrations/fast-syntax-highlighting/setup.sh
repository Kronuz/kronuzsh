# fast-syntax-highlighting: apply the Kronuz theme. fsh's `fast-theme` resolves the
# .ini and writes the styles to its work dir ($FAST_WORK_DIR/current_theme.zsh, under
# ~/.cache), which fsh auto-loads at every shell start. Needs zsh + the fsh plugin,
# so we run it through zsh (this file is POSIX sh, sourced by ../setup.sh at install).
# Idempotent: re-running just re-writes the same theme.
