# kronuzsh

A thin, prezto-free zsh setup: my prompt, three plugins, and a small amount of
config, with no framework underneath. It replaces a 7-years-behind prezto fork
with something I own end to end.

It is deliberately small. The prompt is one file. Everything prezto used to give
me that I actually use is either mine or a standalone plugin:

- **prompt** (`prompt.zsh`) the Kronuz prompt, ported off prezto. Git status comes
  from [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus); the venv, vi/emacs keymap
  indicator, and pwd are tiny native replacements for prezto's python-info,
  editor-info, and prompt-pwd.
- **plugins** (git submodules under `plugins/`):
  [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting),
  [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions),
  [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search),
  and [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus).
- **config**: `env.zsh`, `options.zsh`, `history.zsh`, `completion.zsh`,
  `keybindings.zsh`, `aliases.zsh`, `terminal.zsh` — one named file per concern.

The guiding rule: keep only the **genuinely useful** parts, lean and easy to find,
and prefer zsh-native over a vendored module (e.g. bracketed paste is built in, so
there's no `safe-paste`). No cryptic framework magic; if you want to change
something, the file it lives in is obvious.

## Fonts (Nerd Font)

The prompt uses a few [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) glyphs (the OS logo
by the hostname). Install any Nerd Font and point your terminal at it — e.g.
[MesloLGS Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts):

- macOS: `brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font`, then set it as your
  terminal font.
- **iTerm2 gotcha**: also set it (or uncheck) under *Settings → Profiles → Text →
  "Use a different font for non-ASCII text"* — otherwise the glyphs show as boxes
  even with the right main font.

Without a Nerd Font the prompt still works; the OS logo just shows as tofu (□) —
set `_kronuz_os=''` in `local.zsh` to hide it.

For a longer, opinionated (and surely incomplete) rundown of good coding fonts,
see [NerdFonts.md](NerdFonts.md).

## Install

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Kronuz/kronuzsh.git ~/.config/kronuzsh
cd ~/.config/kronuzsh && ./install.sh
exec zsh
```

`install.sh` symlinks the runcoms (`~/.zshenv`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`,
`~/.zlogin`, `~/.zlogout`) at this repo's `runcoms/`, backing up anything it
replaces, and inits the plugin submodules. It's idempotent; `./install.sh
--uninstall` restores the backups. Symlinks mean editing `~/.zshrc` edits the
tracked `runcoms/zshrc` directly, and `$KRONUZSH` self-resolves through them.

## Machine-local config

Two tiers, by language:

- **`~/.profile`** — cross-shell env (PATH, exports) in POSIX **sh**, shared by
  bash, sh, and zsh; `runcoms/zprofile` sources it for zsh login shells.
- **`local.zsh`** — zsh-only machine tweaks (zstyles, the `PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_HOST`
  override, the `_kronuz_os` glyph, tool hooks like `direnv`). Copy the template;
  it's git-ignored:

  ```bash
  cp ~/.config/kronuzsh/local.zsh.example ~/.config/kronuzsh/local.zsh
  ```

`~/.zshrc.local` is also sourced if present. `/etc/profile` is left to the system.

## gitstatusd (the git prompt engine)

gitstatus needs a small daemon, `gitstatusd`. **It is downloaded, not compiled.**
On the first new shell, the plugin fetches a prebuilt binary for your platform
into `~/.cache/gitstatus/` (from GitHub releases). Nothing is committed here.

- **macOS / a machine with open network**: just works, no action needed.
- **A locked-down host (e.g. behind a corp proxy) where the download is blocked**:
  build it once locally (needs `cmake` + a C++ compiler), or copy the cached
  binary from a machine that could download it:

  ```bash
  ~/.config/kronuzsh/plugins/gitstatus/build -w   # compile gitstatusd locally
  # or: scp host:~/.cache/gitstatus/gitstatusd-linux-x86_64 ~/.cache/gitstatus/
  ```

- **Either way the prompt still works**: if `gitstatusd` isn't up, the git
  segment falls back to a direct `git` call (a little slower on huge repos).

## External tools

A handful of modern CLI tools get wired in automatically **when they're
installed**, and are silently skipped when they aren't, so the same config works
on your laptop, a fresh box, or a server with none of them. What each gets you,
all guarded on the command being present (`integrations.zsh`, except delta which
lives in git config):

- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** — fuzzy finder. The modern
  `fzf --zsh` integration binds **Ctrl-T** (insert a file path), **Ctrl-R**
  (search history; this takes over from the plain incremental search), and
  **Alt-C** (cd into a chosen directory).
- **[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)** — a friendlier `find`, and the engine
  behind fzf's file/dir pickers (hidden files, follows symlinks, skips `.git`).
- **[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)** — a `cd` that learns your
  most-used dirs. Adds `z` (jump) and `zi` (interactive); the real `cd` is left
  alone.
- **[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)** — a syntax-highlighting pager, used
  as the **man pager** and fzf's file preview. It does **not** shadow `cat`.
- **[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)** (`rg`) — a fast `grep`;
  nothing to wire, it just works. Point `$RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` at a config in
  `local.zsh` for defaults.
- **[git-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)** — a syntax-highlighting
  pager for git diffs. `install.sh` sets it in your **global gitconfig** (so you
  get `navigate`, line numbers, and `git add -p` highlighting, not just paging),
  guarded with `command -v delta` so it falls back to `less`/`cat` where delta
  isn't installed. To set it up without re-running the installer:

  ```bash
  git config --global core.pager \
    'if command -v delta >/dev/null 2>&1; then delta; else less; fi'
  git config --global interactive.diffFilter \
    'if command -v delta >/dev/null 2>&1; then delta --color-only; else cat; fi'
  git config --global delta.navigate true
  git config --global delta.line-numbers true
  ```

### Installing them

Per platform (the package names differ, which bites on minimal distros):

```bash
# macOS
brew install fd bat fzf zoxide ripgrep git-delta

# Debian / Ubuntu  (fd installs as `fdfind`, bat as `batcat` — integrations.zsh
# detects both)
sudo apt install fd-find bat fzf zoxide ripgrep git-delta

# Fedora
sudo dnf install fd-find bat fzf zoxide ripgrep git-delta
```

On a **minimal or locked-down distro** whose repos don't carry them (e.g. the
CBL-Mariner dev VM, which only ships `ripgrep`), install from source with Rust,
and grab fzf's prebuilt binary (it's Go, not Rust):

```bash
cargo install --locked fd-find bat zoxide git-delta    # -> ~/.cargo/bin
ver=$(curl -sSL https://api.github.com/repos/junegunn/fzf/releases/latest \
      | grep -m1 tag_name | sed -E 's/.*"v?([^"]+)".*/\1/')
curl -sSL "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/download/v$ver/fzf-$ver-linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
      | tar xz -C ~/.local/bin fzf                      # -> ~/.local/bin
```

(`~/.cargo/bin` and `~/.local/bin` both need to be on `$PATH`; they usually are.)

### More tools worth adding

These need no shell wiring (they're just commands), so they aren't in
`integrations.zsh`; install any and they work. Roughly ranked by daily payoff:

1. **[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)** — a modern `ls` (icons, git,
   tree). *Wired*: when present it takes over the `ls`/`ll`/`la`/`lt` aliases.
2. **[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)** — a terminal git UI
   for staging, rebasing, and stashing; uses your delta config.
3. **[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)** — command-line
   benchmarking with statistics (same author as fd/bat).
4. **[atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin)** — SQLite shell history with
   fuzzy search. *Wired*: when present it owns **Ctrl-R** (replacing fzf's), and
   we keep Up/Down on the substring search.
5. **[jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)** / **[yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)**
   — slice and reshape JSON / YAML.
6. **[dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust)** (`du`) and
   **[duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf)** (`df`) — readable disk usage.
7. **[btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)** (`top`) and
   **[procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs)** (`ps`) — nicer process views.
8. **[sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd)** — `sed`-style find/replace, minus the
   regex pain.
9. **[tealdeer](https://github.com/tealdeer-rs/tealdeer)** (`tldr`) —
   example-first man pages.
10. **[yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)** — a fast terminal file manager.
    *Wired*: when present, `y` opens it and cd's to where you quit.
11. **[tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei)** (count lines of code),
    **[glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)** (render Markdown),
    **[xh](https://github.com/ducaale/xh)** (a fast HTTPie/`curl`).

Most are Rust, so `cargo install <crate>` works anywhere Rust does (the minimal
distro path above). The three marked *Wired* get shell integration in
`integrations.zsh`; the rest just run.
