# kronuzsh

A thin, prezto-free zsh setup: my prompt, three plugins, and a small amount of
config, with no framework underneath. It replaces a 7-years-behind prezto fork
with something I own end to end.

It is deliberately small. The prompt is one file. Everything prezto used to give
me that I actually use is either mine or a standalone plugin:

- **prompt** (`prompt.zsh`) the Kronuz prompt, ported off prezto. Git status comes
  from [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus); the venv, vi/emacs keymap
  indicator, and pwd are tiny native replacements for prezto's python-info,
  editor-info, and prompt-pwd.
- **plugins** (git submodules under `plugins/`):
  [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting),
  [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions),
  [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search),
  and [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus).
- **config**: `env.zsh`, `options.zsh`, `history.zsh`, `completion.zsh`,
  `keybindings.zsh`, `aliases.zsh`, `terminal.zsh` — one named file per concern.

The guiding rule: keep only the **genuinely useful** parts, lean and easy to find,
and prefer zsh-native over a vendored module (e.g. bracketed paste is built in, so
there's no `safe-paste`). No cryptic framework magic; if you want to change
something, the file it lives in is obvious.

## Fonts (Nerd Font)

The prompt uses a few [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) glyphs (the OS logo
by the hostname). Install any Nerd Font and point your terminal at it — e.g.
[MesloLGS Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts):

- macOS: `brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font`, then set it as your
  terminal font.
- **iTerm2 gotcha**: also set it (or uncheck) under *Settings → Profiles → Text →
  "Use a different font for non-ASCII text"* — otherwise the glyphs show as boxes
  even with the right main font.

Without a Nerd Font the prompt still works; the OS logo just shows as tofu (□) —
set `_kronuz_os=''` in `local.zsh` to hide it.

## Install

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Kronuz/kronuzsh.git ~/.config/kronuzsh
cd ~/.config/kronuzsh && ./install.sh
exec zsh
```

`install.sh` symlinks the runcoms (`~/.zshenv`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`,
`~/.zlogin`, `~/.zlogout`) at this repo's `runcoms/`, backing up anything it
replaces, and inits the plugin submodules. It's idempotent; `./install.sh
--uninstall` restores the backups. Symlinks mean editing `~/.zshrc` edits the
tracked `runcoms/zshrc` directly, and `$KRONUZSH` self-resolves through them.

## Machine-local config

Two tiers, by language:

- **`~/.profile`** — cross-shell env (PATH, exports) in POSIX **sh**, shared by
  bash, sh, and zsh; `runcoms/zprofile` sources it for zsh login shells.
- **`local.zsh`** — zsh-only machine tweaks (zstyles, the `PROMPT_KRONUZ_COLOR_HOST`
  override, the `_kronuz_os` glyph, tool hooks like `direnv`). Copy the template;
  it's git-ignored:

  ```bash
  cp ~/.config/kronuzsh/local.zsh.example ~/.config/kronuzsh/local.zsh
  ```

`~/.zshrc.local` is also sourced if present. `/etc/profile` is left to the system.

## gitstatusd (the git prompt engine)

gitstatus needs a small daemon, `gitstatusd`. **It is downloaded, not compiled.**
On the first new shell, the plugin fetches a prebuilt binary for your platform
into `~/.cache/gitstatus/` (from GitHub releases). Nothing is committed here.

- **macOS / a machine with open network**: just works, no action needed.
- **A locked-down host (e.g. behind a corp proxy) where the download is blocked**:
  build it once locally (needs `cmake` + a C++ compiler), or copy the cached
  binary from a machine that could download it:

  ```bash
  ~/.config/kronuzsh/plugins/gitstatus/build -w   # compile gitstatusd locally
  # or: scp host:~/.cache/gitstatus/gitstatusd-linux-x86_64 ~/.cache/gitstatus/
  ```

- **Either way the prompt still works**: if `gitstatusd` isn't up, the git
  segment falls back to a direct `git` call (a little slower on huge repos).

## Layout

```
install.sh         idempotent symlink installer (--uninstall restores backups)
runcoms/
  zshenv           environment, all shells   (~/.zshenv)
  zprofile         login: sources ~/.profile (~/.zprofile)
  zshrc            interactive entry point   (~/.zshrc)
  zlogin           login: bg-compiles the completion dump
  zlogout          logout (stub)
options.zsh        shell options
history.zsh        history (HISTSIZE 10M)
completion.zsh     completion (cached compinit)
keybindings.zsh    key bindings (emacs)
aliases.zsh        the useful aliases (ls colors, ll, mkdir -p, ...)
terminal.zsh       window/tab title
prompt.zsh         the Kronuz prompt (OS glyph, gitstatus, ...)
plugins.zsh        plugin loader
local.zsh.example  machine-local template (real local.zsh is git-ignored)
plugins/           vendored plugins (git submodules)
```
